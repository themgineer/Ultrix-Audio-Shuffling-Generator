# **Audio Shuffling Generator for Ultrix Database**

This is a small application that will take an Excel export from Ross Video Ultrix or Ultricore BCS Sources tables and append audio shuffling sources.

The GUI interface is pretty straightforward. It asks for a source file, an ending index number, a number of audio channels, how you want your audio grouped, and an output filename. Once all of those are provided, just hit the **Shuffle** button and it should generate an Excel file that can be directly imported back into the **Sources** table in Dashboard.

1. Use the **Source File** field to enter or **Browse** to the file path of an Excel file that contains the data you wish to use. Usually, this should be a direct export from Dashboard.
2. If you wish to start at a source other than the first source, enable the **Start ID** checkbox and enter the number from the ID column of the source you want to start using to generate audio sources. The status bar at the bottom will tell you the source name associated with that index number.
3. Choose the last source by entering the **End ID** value of the last source you want to use to generate audio sources. The status bar at the bottom will tell you the source name associated with that index number.
4. By default, audio shuffling will be generated with 16 channels of audio. If you would like to change that, use the **Channels** dropdown and choose the number of audio levels in your database (**2**, **4**, **8**, or **16**).
5. By default, audio shuffling with use each channel as a discrete mono audio channel. If you would like to group channels, use the **Grouping** dropdown and choose how you want the audio channels grouped (**Mono**, **Stereo**, **Quad**, or **Octo**)
6. Enable the **Leading Zeroes** checkbox if you want channel numbers 1-9 to be displayed with a leading zero (01-09)
7. The **Output File** field will automatically update based on the file name defined earlier in **Source File**. You can also manually enter or **Browse** to the file you wish the output to save as.
8. Press the **Shuffle** button to generate the output Excel file at the path defined in **Output File**.

## **Input Data Structure**

The source file is intended to be an Excel file exported from the Sources table of a Ross Video Ultrix or Ultricore BCS. The application expects a *sources* worksheet and the internal data to follow the form generated by the export.
